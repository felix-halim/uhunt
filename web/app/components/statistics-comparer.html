<h2 align="center">Statistics Comparer</h2>

<p>
It is good to have partners (or rivals) in any competitions. Rivals can give you
strong motivations to improve yourself. One of the motivations can be: "to solve
any problem that your rivals solves, just to stay ahead from your rivals :)".
</p>

<p>
Using set manipulations you can merge your statistics with your partners and
compare it with other groups of rivals :D interesting, isn't it? See the
following examples. The variables A,B,C,D,E are the usernames of the users.
</p>

<ul>
<li>To know what are the the problems you (A) have solved but your rivals
(B,C,D,E) do not, execute the following set operation: <b>A-B-C-D-E</b> or
<b>A-(B+C+D+E)</b>.

<li>Suppose you and your partners form a group (A,C) and your rivals form
another group (B,E). To see what problems that your group hasn't solved but
your rival has, execute this set operation: <b>(A+C)-(B+E)</b>.

<li>Now if you want to know what are the problems that your group and your
rivals have not solved, there is a special set <b style="color:blue">S</b> which
contains all problems in UVa OJ. So you can do set operation:
<b>S-(A+C)-(B+E)</b> or <b>S-(A+C+B+E)</b> or <b>S-A-C-B-E</b>.

<li>There are other special sets: <b style="color:blue">cp3</b> and
<b style="color:blue">cp3s</b> which contains all problems in the 3rd edition
Competitive Programming book and the starred only. For the 1st and 2nd edition
exercises, change the number accordingly (cp1, cp1s, cp2, cp2s).
</ul>

<p>The available operators are:
union <b style="color:blue">+</b>,
subtraction <b style="color:blue">-</b>,
intersection <b style="color:blue">&</b>,
and brackets <b style="color:blue">(</b> <b style="color:blue">)</b>
to force operator precedence.</p>
